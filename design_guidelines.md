# Divine Align Design Portfolio - Angela Rose Boyle
## Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Aesthetic Direction**: Professional minimalist foundation with celestial-botanical whimsy. Clean, spacious layouts that exude UX expertise credibility, enhanced by subtle teal/gold sophistication and delicate celestial/vine motifs. Think Stripe's restraint meets Notion's polish with starlit elegance. Reference: Brittany Chiang, Adham Dannaway portfolios - adapt structure with Divine Align's refined whimsy.

**Brand Philosophy**: "Where logic meets imagination" - every design choice balances professional authority with creative soul.

## Core Design Elements

### Typography System
- **Display**: Playfair Display for "Angela Rose Boyle", "Divine Align Design", section headers - serif elegance
- **Body**: Inter for all content, navigation, case study text - modern readability
- **Hierarchy**: 
  - Name/Brand: text-7xl to text-8xl, serif, medium weight
  - Tagline: text-2xl, serif, light italic
  - Section headers: text-5xl, serif, medium
  - Subheaders: text-2xl, sans-serif, semibold
  - Body: text-lg, sans-serif, regular
  - Captions: text-sm, sans-serif, light

### Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Tailwind units of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32
- Section padding: py-24 to py-32 desktop, py-16 mobile

### Visual Treatment
- **Shadows**: Sophisticated elevation - shadow-lg for cards, shadow-2xl for modals
- **Corners**: rounded-2xl for major cards, rounded-xl for buttons/inputs
